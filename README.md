beta genesis and readme about what we are doing. More to come
The New Management Inc.

Web3 has great potential for users to own their value, by this we mean the value of the content they create,the data that they share,the ads that they click, or the platforms they join, all of this is valuable.  With web3 and crypto, content creators can create content and monetize it ,selling it at their own price, and keep much more of their earnings compared to if they used any traditional platform.

The problem so far has been how to make it easy to use , and how to make it scale. Our engine solves both of these issues. Our platform can integrate into existing web2 tech stacks in a modular fashion. Our ERC-1155 tokens allow for gasless function calls and low gas minting, and once deploy that contract can power future contracts or decentralized apps. We are nearly finished a bridge protocol so that private chains can  join ours in a type of currency union.

 Our platform can serve content directly from our chain and without a centralized server. This content can be images,code,json, and other common building blocks used in web app development today. With a few lines of code an existing game can be turned into an exciting web3 game, the developer can add a new monetization avenue by making their in-game items on the chain. This isnâ€™t meant for play to earn, it can be but the real value will be in how it enhances games. 

We think most de-fi protocols are not truly decentralized. We think the security vulnerabilities are a feature and not a bug, and that there is a built-in incentive for the swap protocol stake-holders to allow scams because they get paid either way.

So we need to get started on the decentralized part right away. Proof of work is the best consensus method at this time, eventually we plan to move to a proof of time so that anyone can participate in the chain, but that will require a huge team, and tons of work  this move to proof of stake is the worst move in our opinion. The Proof Of Stake model was stupid when he proposed in back in 2014 and it is stupid now.

Right now we have a pretty big toolbox that we are getting read to open source, our core tools will be open source to encourage development. Anyone of any skill level can mint tokens right now using our  engine,and we are very close to finishing up the initial api and toolkit.

At this moment you can access the beta chain that we used for testing and the genesis file is obnoxiously large. When we roll out to to production, the genesis will probably include about 30 million tokens prefunded,eventually we plan to put up about quarter of that into an IEO. 

While the major exchanges are hesitant right now to take on any new chains for an IEO,especially proof of work, we can honestly just host our own pre-sale auction once we have enough nodes. Miners are getting in early, and we are starting at 0.

We really need nodes, who can spare any hashing power. In the mean time feel free to mess around with our beta chain. Check our some of our tools, we have even better products getting ready to release soon.
